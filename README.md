# **IoT Motor Monitoring System Based on STM32F103**

This project uses an ESP-01 to extract sensor data, perform average and peak detection over time, and send the processed data to ThingSpeak. A terminal/dashboard can be created on ThingSpeak to visualize all the graphs.

Sudden spikes in peak values are normal, while average values going too high or too low indicate a potential issue and suggest the need for a maintenance checkup.
