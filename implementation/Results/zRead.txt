Obviously, current isnt calibrated..The rest of the readings are pretty accurate..

you can actually see the trends, when the motor was off and then turned on.. 

abnormalties arent shown because... well they didnt occur with this motor... 

but it does work.. and will show any anomalies w the readings :)
