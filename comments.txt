Folder items overview:

->	Arduino Test Codes: Upload to arduino and check the working of your adxl345, and esp-01

->	Reference Datasheets: Not un-necessary stuff. Basic register map of adxl and AT Command list for esp.. PS goated baremetal coding book for stm32f1xx

->	Implementation: Working Circuit pics, along with block diagram and un-calibrated result waveforms

->	Arduino Test Codes > Random code bits: If you need to get to the baremetal working of the code. 
			PS there is a "debug.txt", it has functions list to enable and send stuff through uart, like arduino serial monitor... but FTDI is needed
->	Code + RTOS files: MAIN SOURCE CODE FOR THE WORK. contains necessary libraries, and code files

->	PROBLEMS.docx: the problems that occured in working, and what we tried
